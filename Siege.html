    <h1>Source Three: The Siege of Leningrad</h1>
    <p>While many primary sources on the experiences of hunger are meant to convey terror, fear or guilt; some secondary sources such as this pamphlet provide a positive lookback on such a tragic event. While many suffered and died over this 900 day siege and seizing of food, water, and others, those who remained described the survival of the city as a "symbol of soviet courage and unity." Rations quickly fell below substinence levels, but a glimmer of hope known as "The Road of Life" would bring in supplies and evacuate civilians under the noses of the Nazis and Fins. This event fortunately never went in the Nazis' way, the event being used as propaganda to drive Soviets and others to join the war and demonize Germany and destroy them for good.</p>
