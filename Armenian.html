    <h1>Source Five: The Armenian Famine (The Ottomans' Wrath)</h1>
    <p>The worst example of hunger's genocidal power. The Ottomans were a brutal dictatorial empire that systemaically murdered millions of Armenians during "starve marches." These Armenians were forced to walk hundreds if not thousands of miles on foot, completely deprived of food or water. Civilians were a main target in this genocide, trying to kill as many as possible. Some were also sent to concentration camps, where starvation also withheld. All food imports and food were promptly seized. To this day, the Turkish government (once part of the Ottoman Empire) completely denies this event ever occuring.</p>
